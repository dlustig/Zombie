Update on my stuff:
I'm fixing the high scores pop up. Also, now that I've found a better way to organize it, I will 
hopfully have time to go back and organize the main file with the new way that I've done it. It's
not changing any of the actual running, just the code organization. I've also figured out how to
set the frame size and the relative position of the window to the middle of the screen, so once
I've figured out what I'm messing up in the high scores gui I'll fix that in the main, too.

Also, what are we doing for the level ups/levels again? I need to fix those in the main file 
and do the separate classes for those if we are doing them separately from the zombie class.

Update as of Sun, 6pm:
Having issues. The layout that I created for the main java file won't recognize when the buttons are clicked,
except for pause, for some reason. It also won't stay the fixed size that I created it to be. Arg.
Going to fix that, and then I will try and put the images as the background. Also, how are we implementing
the zombies showing up in that main screen?
