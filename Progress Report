Update on my stuff:
I'm fixing the high scores pop up. Also, now that I've found a better way to organize it, I will 
hopfully have time to go back and organize the main file with the new way that I've done it. It's
not changing any of the actual running, just the code organization. I've also figured out how to
set the frame size and the relative position of the window to the middle of the screen, so once
I've figured out what I'm messing up in the high scores gui I'll fix that in the main, too.

Also, what are we doing for the level ups/levels again? I need to fix those in the main file 
and do the separate classes for those if we are doing them separately from the zombie class.
